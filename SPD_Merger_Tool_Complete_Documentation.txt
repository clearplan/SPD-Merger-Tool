QUICK START GUIDE
================================================================================

STEP 1: OPEN THE TOOL
----------------------
Double-click SPD_Merger_Tool_v1_2.html
The tool opens in your default web browser - no installation required.

STEP 2: ADD YOUR FILES
----------------------
• Drag and drop all SPD ZIP files into the drop zone
• Or click the drop zone to browse and select files
• Add as many files as needed (minimum 2)
• Files can be added all at once or incrementally

STEP 3: REVIEW FILE LIST
-------------------------
The tool displays all loaded files:
  
  File 1 (PRIMARY) ★
    • No prefix applied
    • Original IDs preserved
    • Green highlighted
  
  Files 2-N (SECONDARY)
    • Auto-generated prefixes (editable)
    • Click prefix field to customize
    • Remove button available

STEP 4: CONFIGURE MERGE
------------------------
Choose your hierarchy strategy:

  ○ Separate Hierarchies
    All file hierarchies remain as parallel Level 1 structures
    Good for: Independent subprojects, parallel work streams
  
  ○ Create New Root Summary
    All hierarchies placed under a new master root task
    Good for: Integrated programs, master project views
    Enter name: "Master Program" (or your preferred name)

STEP 5: MERGE
-------------
• Click "Merge N SPD Files" button
• Monitor progress bar
• Wait for completion message

STEP 6: DOWNLOAD
----------------
• Click "Download Merged SPD" - Your integrated schedule
• Click "Download Log File" - Complete merge documentation
• Review log for any warnings or issues
• Import merged SPD into your scheduling tool


HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

AUTOMATIC PREFIX STRATEGY
--------------------------
With multiple files, the tool uses automatic prefixing:

  File 1:  No prefix (PRIMARY)
           Original IDs preserved exactly as-is
  
  Files 2-N:  Receive prefixes
              All task IDs, resource IDs, calendar IDs get prefix
              Relationships automatically remapped

Example:
  Input Files:
    1. Prime_Contractor.zip      → No prefix
    2. Subcontractor_A.zip       → Prefix: "SUBCONTRACTOR_A_"
    3. Propulsion_System.zip     → Prefix: "PROPULSION_SYSTEM_"
  
  Result IDs:
    From File 1:  TASK-001, TASK-002, RES-A, RES-B
    From File 2:  SUBCONTRACTOR_A_TASK-001, SUBCONTRACTOR_A_RES-A
    From File 3:  PROPULSION_SYSTEM_TASK-001, PROPULSION_SYSTEM_RES-A

EDITING PREFIXES
----------------
You can customize any auto-generated prefix:
  1. Click in the prefix field
  2. Type your preferred prefix
  3. Press Enter or click outside the field
  
  Valid characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, underscore (_), dash (-)
  Invalid: Spaces, special characters (!@#$%^&*)
  
  The tool validates in real-time and warns about duplicates.

SEQUENTIAL MERGE ALGORITHM
---------------------------
The tool merges files one at a time:
  
  Step 1: File 1 becomes the base
  Step 2: Merge File 2 into base → Intermediate result
  Step 3: Merge File 3 into intermediate → New intermediate
  Step 4: Continue for all files
  Step 5: Apply hierarchy strategy to final result
  Step 6: Validate complete merged SPD
  
  Benefits:
    • Memory efficient - only 2 files in memory at once
    • Clear progression tracking
    • Handles large file sets
    • Detailed step-by-step logging

VALIDATION & DATA INTEGRITY
================================================================================

The tool performs extensive validation:

FILE FORMAT CHECKS
  ✓ Valid ZIP structure
  ✓ FileType.txt present and correct
  ✓ All required JSON files present
  ✓ Valid JSON syntax

FFS COMPLIANCE CHECKS
  ✓ Primary key uniqueness (task IDs, resource IDs, etc.)
  ✓ Foreign key integrity (relationships reference valid tasks)
  ✓ Task hierarchy rules (valid levels, parent references)
  ✓ Calendar integrity (workshifts, exceptions)
  ✓ Resource assignment references
  ✓ Date logic and consistency

CONSTRAINT VALIDATION
  ✓ No ID collisions after prefixing
  ✓ No orphaned relationships
  ✓ No invalid task levels
  ✓ No missing calendar references
  ✓ No dangling resource assignments

All validation results are documented in the log file.


TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Browser says "Out of Memory"
SOLUTION: 
  • Close other browser tabs
  • Use Chrome or Edge (better memory management)
  • Merge in smaller batches if dealing with 10+ large files
  • Restart browser between large operations

PROBLEM: Tool won't load files / Error loading file
SOLUTION:
  • Verify files are valid SPD ZIP files
  • Check that FileType.txt exists in ZIP
  • Ensure files aren't corrupted
  • Try loading files one at a time to isolate bad file

PROBLEM: Prefix field turns red / Invalid prefix error
SOLUTION:
  • Use only: letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), underscore (_), dash (-)
  • No spaces or special characters
  • Prefix cannot be empty for secondary files

PROBLEM: Warning about duplicate prefixes
SOLUTION:
  • Edit one or both prefixes to make them unique
  • Tool prevents merge until duplicates are resolved

PROBLEM: Merge takes very long time
SOLUTION:
  • Normal for 10+ files or very large files (>10,000 tasks each)
  • Allow 1-2 minutes for large operations
  • Don't close browser during merge
  • Progress bar shows operation is still running

PROBLEM: Want to change primary file
SOLUTION:
  • Remove all files from list (click Remove button on each)
  • Re-add files with desired primary file first
  • Primary file is always the first file added

PROBLEM: Auto-generated prefix is too long
SOLUTION:
  • Click in prefix field and edit to shorter version
  • Example: "PROPULSION_SYSTEM_" → "PROP_"
  • Press Enter to save

PROBLEM: Can't import merged file to scheduling tool
SOLUTION:
  • Check log file validation section for errors
  • Errors (✗) must be resolved before import
  • Warnings (⚠) are usually acceptable
  • Verify scheduling tool supports IPMDAR SPD format
  • Contact tool vendor if import still fails


BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

BEFORE MERGING
--------------
☑ Back up all original SPD files
☑ Verify all files are from compatible tools/versions
☑ Check that status dates are reasonably close
☑ Understand the project structures you're combining
☑ Plan your prefix strategy (meaningful, concise)
☑ Decide on appropriate hierarchy strategy

DURING MERGE
------------
☑ Add files in desired order (primary file first)
☑ Review auto-generated prefixes - customize if needed
☑ Use meaningful, short prefixes (SUBA_, PROP_, P1_)
☑ Ensure no duplicate prefixes (tool will warn)
☑ Choose correct hierarchy strategy for your use case
☑ Don't close browser window during merge

AFTER MERGE
-----------
☑ Always download and save the log file
☑ Review all warnings in log file
☑ Check final statistics make sense
☑ Import to scheduling tool and verify
☑ Spot-check several tasks from each source file
☑ Verify relationships look correct
☑ Check that critical paths make sense
☑ Validate resource assignments
☑ Review custom fields if applicable


ADVANCED TOPICS
================================================================================

HANDLING VERY LARGE MERGES (10+ FILES)
---------------------------------------
For merges involving many files or very large files:
  1. Close all other browser tabs
  2. Use Chrome or Edge (recommended)
  3. Consider merging in two stages:
     • Stage 1: Merge primary + 4-5 files → Intermediate SPD
     • Stage 2: Merge intermediate + remaining files → Final SPD
  4. Allow adequate time (up to 2-3 minutes possible)
  5. Monitor browser memory usage via Task Manager

PREFIX NAMING STRATEGIES
-------------------------
Good prefix patterns:
  ✓ Contractor-based:    PRIME_, SUBA_, SUBB_
  ✓ Subsystem-based:     AVI_, PROP_, STRUCT_, SW_
  ✓ Phase-based:         P1_, P2_, P3_, P4_
  ✓ Location-based:      WEST_, EAST_, OFFSHORE_
  ✓ Functional:          DESIGN_, BUILD_, TEST_

Avoid:
  ✗ Generic: FILE2_, FILE3_
  ✗ Too long: PROPULSION_SUBSYSTEM_INTEGRATION_
  ✗ Inconsistent: Phase1_, P2, PHASE_3

HIERARCHY STRATEGY SELECTION
-----------------------------
Choose "Separate Hierarchies" when:
  • Files represent independent subprojects
  • You need parallel work stream visibility
  • Integration is loose/informational only
  • Files have fundamentally different structures

Choose "Create New Root Summary" when:
  • You need unified program view
  • Creating master integrated schedule
  • Reporting to single program office
  • Files represent components of one program

OFFLINE DEPLOYMENT
------------------
For classified or air-gapped environments:
  1. Download JSZip library (jszip.min.js) from CDN
  2. Place in same directory as HTML file
  3. Edit HTML to reference local JSZip file:
     Change: src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jszip/3.10.1/jszip.min.js"
     To:     src="./jszip.min.js"
  4. Tool now operates completely offline
